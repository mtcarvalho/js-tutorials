    <!--
        The earliest method of registering event handlers found on the Web involved 
        event handler HTML attributes (or inline event handlers) like the one shown above — 
        the attribute value is literally the JavaScript code you want to run when the event occurs. 
        The above example invokes a function defined inside a <script> element on the same page, 
        but you could also insert JavaScript directly inside the attribute, for example:

        <button onclick="alert('Hello, this is my old-fashioned event handler!');">Press me</button>

        You can find HTML attribute equivalents for many of the event handler properties; 
        however, you SHOULDN'T use these — they are considered bad practice. 
        It might seem easy to use an event handler attribute if you are doing something really quick, 
        but they quickly become unmanageable and inefficient.

      function random(number) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random()*number);
      }

      function bgChange() {
        const rndCol = 'rgb(' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ')';
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
