      /* Event Bubbling and Capture */

      // event bubbling and capture are two mechanisms that describe what happens when 
      // two handlers of the same event type are activated on one element.

      // there's a problem — currently, when you select the video it starts to play, 
      // it causes the <div> to be hidden at the same time. This is because the video is inside the <div> — 
      // it is part of it — so selecting the video actually runs both the above event handlers.

      // Bubbling and Capturing explained
      /*
        When an event is fired on an element that has parent elements (in this case, the <video> has the <div> as a parent), 
        modern browsers run two different phases — the capturing phase and the bubbling phase.

        In the capturing phase:

        1. The browser checks to see if the element's outer-most ancestor (<html>) has an onclick event handler 
        registered on it for the capturing phase, and runs it if so.
        2. Then it moves on to the next element inside <html> and does the same thing, 
        then the next one, and so on until it reaches the element that was actually selected.

        In the bubbling phase, the exact opposite occurs:


        1. The browser checks to see if the element selected has an onclick 
        event handler registered on it for the bubbling phase, and runs it if so.
        2. Then it moves on to the next immediate ancestor element and does the same thing, 
        then the next one, and so on until it reaches the <html> element.

        In modern browsers, by default, all event handlers are registered for the bubbling phase. 
        So in our current example, when you select the video, 
        the event bubbles from the <video> element outwards to the <html> element. Along the way:

        1. It finds the video.onclick... handler and runs it, so the video first starts playing.
        2. It then finds the videoBox.onclick... handler and runs it, so the video is hidden as well.

        Note: In cases where both types of event handlers are present, bubbling and capturing, 
        the capturing phase will run first, followed by the bubbling phase.
