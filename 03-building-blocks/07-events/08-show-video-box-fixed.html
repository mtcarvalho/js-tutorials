      /* Fixing Event Bubbling and Capture problem with stopPropagation() */

      // the standard Event object has a function available on it called stopPropagation() which, 
      // when invoked on a handler's event object, makes it so that first handler is run but 
      // the event doesn't bubble any further up the chain, so no more handlers will be run.

      /* Notes */

      /*
        Why bother with both capturing and bubbling? Well, in the bad old days when browsers were much less 
        cross-compatible than they are now, Netscape only used event capturing, and Internet Explorer 
        used only event bubbling. When the W3C decided to try to standardize the behavior and reach a consensus, 
        they ended up with this system that included both, which is the one modern browsers implemented.

        As mentioned above, by default all event handlers are registered in the bubbling phase, and this makes 
        more sense most of the time. If you really want to register an event in the capturing phase instead, 
        you can do so by registering your handler using addEventListener(), and setting the optional third property to true.
      */

      /* Event Delegation */

      /*
        Bubbling also allows us to take advantage of event delegation â€” this concept relies on the fact that 
        if you want some code to run when you select any one of a large number of child elements, 
        you can set the event listener on their parent and have events that happen on them bubble up to their parent 
        rather than having to set the event listener on every child individually. 
        Remember, bubbling involves checking the element the event is fired on for an event handler first, 
        then moving up to the element's parent, etc.
