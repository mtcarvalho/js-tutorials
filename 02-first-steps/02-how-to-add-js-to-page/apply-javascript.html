        OR just declare function in script.js with button here as:
        <button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!</button>

        Please don't do this, however. It is bad practice to pollute your HTML with JavaScript, 
        and it is inefficient â€” you'd have to include the onclick="createParagraph()" 
        attribute on every button you want the JavaScript to apply to.

  <script src="script.js" defer></script> 
  <!-- The defer attribute is a boolean attribute. 
    When present, it specifies that the script is 
    executed when the page has finished parsing.

    we can also use async here on script tag:
    async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, 
    while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked by the scripts.
    If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use async.
    If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, 
    load them using defer and put their corresponding <script> elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
